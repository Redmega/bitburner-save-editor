# Butburner Save Editor

## Archived

I haven't played Bitburner in years, leaving this up for others who are interested in how they might start a project like this, but it's no longer being maintained or updated.

## Usage

https://redmega.github.io/bitburner-save-editor/

Open the save editor and upload your exported Bitburner save file. When you're done editing, you can click the download icon in the header to get a new version of your save that you can import to the game.
